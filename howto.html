      The team at meshmapper.net have onboarded Florida! They have a lot of great features, tools that help
      protect the mesh airtime while wardriving, and <em>native wardrive apps</em>! In order to help build the best
      coverage map while using the least amount of airtime, We've decided to retire the map and encourage everyone to
      start using their tools. I'm working with the team to migrate all the data we've collected so far so we
      don't lose any of our hard work. We'll leave this map up, but wardriving is no longer supported.

      This project maps "effective" coverage of the Florida MeshCore mesh. Your radio can tell
      you if a repeater heard you, but that does not show whether your message went further.
      MQTT observers confirm where messages are widely received.

      <a class="underline text-sky-300" target="_blank" href="/">The coverage map</a>
      is a crowd-sourced view of repeater coverage in the Florida MeshCore mesh.

    <div>
      The main map includes:
      <ul class="pl-4 text-sm list-disc">

            <li>Green dot - observed ping.</li>
            <li>Orange dot - repeated, not observed.</li>
            <li>Red dot - ping was lost.</li>
            <li>Small purple dot - RxLog sample uploaded.</li>
          </ul>

            <li>Red box - mesh not reachable.</li>
            <li>Dark tiles - updated within the past day, no new sample needed.</li>

  <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-100">How it works</h2>
  <div class="mb-2 pl-4 text-base">
    You send your location to #wardrive as "lat.xxxx lon.yyyy". If it is received,
    the map records a reachable point. The wardrive web app can also log misses
    automatically. A point is "reachable" only if a repeat is observed by MQTT.

    <a class="underline text-sky-300" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhpzdhJeT2w" target="_blank">video
      overview</a>
    of the project and how to get started.
  </div>

  <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-100">How you can contribute</h2>
  <div class="mb-2 pl-4 text-base">
    The easiest way to contribute is to use the
    <a class="underline text-sky-300" target="_blank" href="/wardrive">Wardrive app</a>.
    It connects to your companion radio and can send ping messages automatically.
    It also posts your ping location so misses are logged. Use single pings or
    auto mode, which only pings tiles that have not been updated recently. The
    app listens for repeats and submits repeater and radio stats, which can help
    identify repeaters not reaching the larger mesh.
  </div>
  <div class="mb-2 ml-4 rounded-lg border border-slate-700 bg-slate-800/60 p-3 text-base">
    Passive wardriving helps too: just connect your radio and the app will collect RxLog-based
    samples when it hears group traffic. Active pings are best reserved for new areas or testing
    a new repeater deployment; in well-covered regions, they add little value. Fewer pings are
    better for the mesh, so use auto mode or short bursts instead of constant manual pings.
  </div>

  <h3 class="mb-2 pl-4 text-lg text-slate-100">Leaderboard</h3>
  <div class="mb-2 pl-4 text-base">
    The leaderboard counts tiles per day per person, not individual pings. Both active and
    passive samples contribute, so you can help just by staying connected. We avoid counting
    individual pings to discourage unnecessary flood messages.
  </div>

  <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-100">Using the Wardrive app</h2>
  <div class="mb-2 pl-4 text-base">
      It mostly "just works", but a few things matter:
    <ul class="mb-2 pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
      <li class="text-amber-300"><b>If you are using a mobile repeater, use "ignore id" to exclude it from the path.
        Otherwise coverage data will be inaccurate.</b>
        <ul class="pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
          <li>Radio statistics (SNR/RSSI) cannot be collected if you're using a mobile repeater.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You must allow access to Bluetooth and Location in your browser.</li>
      <li>Your companion radio must add the #wardrive channel. The app will help with that.</li>
      <li>It does not work in Safari or most vendor-modded Android browsers.
        <ul class="pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
          <li>On macOS use Edge or Chrome.</li>
          <li>On iOS, use the <a class="underline text-sky-300" target="_blank"
              href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluefy-web-ble-browser/id1492822055">Bluefy app</a>
          </li>
          <li>On Android use <a class="underline text-sky-300" target="_blank"
              href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.emmx">Edge</a>
            or <a class="underline text-sky-300" target="_blank"
              href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome">Chrome</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You have to disconnect from the MeshCore app in order to connect to your radio. BLE only allows one
        connection.</li>
      <li>If you're using auto mode, the page must stay foreground and the screen unlocked.
        <ul class="pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
          <li>It tries to keep the screen alive while running, but I've only tested on iOS.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Auto mode checks every 10 seconds and only pings tiles that need an update (not pinged in the past day).</li>
      <li>Do not spam the mesh or the service. The mesh is a shared resource.</li>

    The service stores the location you send to #wardrive and the id of the 1st hop repeater.
    The web app sends your location to #wardrive and to the service. Logging stays local.
    Your companion radio name is sent with your location to #wardrive, which is a public channel.
    <b>Optionally</b>, if you want to participate in the leaderboard, you can choose to send your radio name with pings.
